## About PyPortal and CircuitPython

This code is meant to run on a PyPortal running CircuitPython 4.1.2

An [Adafruit PyPortal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4116) is an wifi-enabled microcontroller device featuring a 3" capacitive touchscreen and CircuitPython baked in. It can be programmed with [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/), a variant of Python that can be used to program microcontrollers.
